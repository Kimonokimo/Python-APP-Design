# Python-APP-Design

This repository consists of my submissions for the course: Python and Applications to Business Analytics, taught by Professor Ahmad Namini.

### The goal of my work:

##### 1) Develop an intuitive feel of how to model a business process to a computer-recognizable, Python form. 
##### 2) Design, code, test, and deploy modular, scalable, maintainable Python applications using Python packages along with object-oriented programming methods. 
##### 3) Implement Python applications in business analytics.

### Submissions:
* In the `Python_APP_Basic`, I wrote a small program to do the medium-high level of mathematics and basic business analysis.
* In the `Currency_Exchange_APP`, I modeled the foreign exchange market rates and 	bid and ask rates as a percentage of FX rates, checked whether an arbitrage condition exists, and conducted understandable outputs.
* In the `Poker_Game_Design`, I wrote a computer program to determine the probability of the poker hands rank.
* In the `ConnectFour_Game_Design`, I created a new game called Connect Four, in which a player wins who can succeed in placing four of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal in a grid of 6 rows by 7 columns (an updated version of the Tic-tac-toe game).
